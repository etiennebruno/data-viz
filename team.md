We are Etienne and Mehdi, two dedicated individuals who have embarked on an exciting journey of exploring the vast and intricate landscape of New York City's bike system. Our initiative focuses on the critical intersection of urban mobility and data analysis, aiming to deliver an insightful and comprehensive depiction of the city's bike usage trends.
